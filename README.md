Student learning state analysis system (SLSAS)


The analysis system of the student classroom learning state based on machine vision can acquire students' learning state by detecting students' behavior. The system can quickly identify abnormal behavior and negative state of students, and the maverick can be prompted to the teachers so as to take pertinent measures to improve their learning effect in time. It realizes the function of quantitative analysis and evaluation of students' learning state, which is of great significance to establish a diversified teaching evaluation system and further improve the feedback-regulation mechanism in educational and teaching activities. 

SLSAS establishes a complete set of analysis system mentioned above. Computer vision and deep learning are used to detect students' behavior, and the state model is constructed and analyzed to obtain the studentsâ€™ learning state. By completing the construction of self-developed platform, issuing self-made data annotation tools, collecting and making students' behavior data sets, developing detection algorithm, establishing a multilevel model of students' learning state, and developing a student learning state analysis system. It realizes the function of analyzing students' learning state.

The innovation of SLSAS is as follows:
1. Student behavior and state are studied separately to achieve the goal that objective behavior can be detected and subjective state can be analyzed. 
2. It covers more comprehensive student behavior. This paper covers seven kinds of behaviors. It also systematically expounds the relationship between independent and interactive behaviors, individual and group behaviors in students' behavior. 
3. It establishes a multilevel model of students' learning state, and realize the multidimensional visual analysis from students' behavior to students' learning state. 
4. A self-developed platform called " Small " is constructed. Simplified behavior detection algorithm can run on it in real time. The front-end and back-end collaboration scheme can also be used. In this scheme, " Small " is used as a high sampling-rate acquisition platform, while the back-end runs the high accuracy algorithm, giving full play to the capabilities of the learning state analysis system.
